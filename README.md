# autoWateringPJ
Just like repository name, it's an auto watering project, and it's very simple (Proteus, Arduino &amp; Thinkspeak with Virtual Serial)
### About the the reason of this project
- Well, I am not an expert in embedded programming, so when I studied this subject, everything was really difficult. 
- But thanks to my copypasta skill and info from many sources, I created a small project that can consider a IoT project (i mean, it's qualification to be an IoT project). 
- I believe there is no faster way to learn than by reading raw code, so... I hope my "assignment"  can help you guy study more quickly.
### How to setup
- First, you need to install VSPE (the .rar file)
- Then, download Arduino IDE and Proteus 8. Don't forget to download the library used in the project as well.
- Start VSPE, create COM 1 and COM 2, and make sure they are connected to each other.
- Run the virtual board first (COM 1), then the Python file (COM 2). Get the API key from ThingSpeak, paste it inside the Python file, and everything is done!
### Note
- Make sure VSPE is working, if it's not, the project won't run correctly.
- The baud rate of COM 1 should be the same as COM 2.
- Big thanks to India bros and ChatGPT for helping me finish this in under 3 hours before the deadline :D
