# autoWateringPJ
Just like repository name, it's an auto watering project, and it's very simple (Proteus, Arduino &amp; Thinkspeak with Virtual Serial)
### About the the reason of this project
- Well, I am not an expert in embedded programming, so when I studied this subject, everything was really difficult. 
- But thanks to my copypasta skill and info from many sources, I created a small project that can consider a IoT project (i mean, it's qualification to be an IoT project). 
- I believe there is no faster way to learn than by reading raw code, so... I hope my "assignment"  can help you guy study more quickly.
